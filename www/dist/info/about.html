            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>We have worked on many different web applications using a multitude of tech stacks and always feel the pain point
                when trying to introduce something new or reconfigure what we have.</p>

            <p>The desire to reduce the need for every web application developer to know the intricacies of configuring every
                dev tool was our main goal.</p>

            <p>But also, when a new and exciting tool is launched we want you to be able to try it out with your current setup
                without needing to reconfigure everything under the sun.</p>

            <p>As developers, we don't want to spend our time trying to configure our tech stacks, we want to develop.</p>

            <p>... and thus, UniteJS was born.</p>
