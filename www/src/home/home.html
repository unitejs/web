                <h1>Goals</h1>
                <p>The aim of UniteJS is to provide a CLI tool which you can use to create a ready to roll application with
                    code, styling, unit tests and e2e tests. All combinations of the chosen technologies provide the same
                    set of tasks to run and produce the same output.</p>

                <p>We try not to be too opinionated in what is produced but sometimes that can't be helped <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i></p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- <div class="row m-0 brand-stripe-2">
            <div class="container padding-top padding-bottom">
                <p>You can see what the app provides out of the box in the <a href="https://github.com/unitejs/cli/blob/master/docs/generated-app.md"

                <p>In addition there are some extras built-in like <b>icon generation</b> and <b>platform packaging</b>.</p>

                    have made.
