            <p>A short guide to the important features in major releases. You can get a more detailed view in the
                <a href="https://github.com/unitejs/engine/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Changelog">Changelog</a>
            </p>

            <p>Remember to get the latest features, update the global unitejs-cli package and then update your project:</p>
            <pre><code au-prism="nix">npm -g install unitejs-cli [or] yarn global add unitejs-cli
unite configure</code></pre>

            <h2>v1.6.2</h2>
            <p>Updated Angular to v5
            </p>

            <h2>v1.6.1</h2>
            <p>Added Progressive Web App (PWA) support, you can enable it by setting the flag in one of your build configurations
                e.g.
            </p>
            <pre><code au-prism="nix">unite buildConfiguration --operation=add --configurationName=dev --pwa</code></pre>
            <p>The PWA additions include ./build/assets/pwa/service-worker-template.js which is used as the basis for the service
                worker, the service worker cache name and contents are automatically populated based on your project contents
                during the new build-create-pwa tasks.</p>
            <p>The manifest file in ./assets/favicon/manifest.json which already existed has some additional fields, this file
                is automatically generated based on your project with additional information pulled from ./assetsSrc/theme/unite.json.</p>
            <p>You must have the theme assets built before doing a PWA build, so don't forget to run gulp theme-build.</p>

            <hr/>

            <p>Added a default loading spinner to the index page, which is automatically removed when the application is loaded.</p>
            <p>You can customize the spinner style and content by modifying the appLoaderStyle and appLoader properties in the
                ./assetsSrc/theme/unite.json file, or remove it entirely.</p>

            <hr/>

            <p>Added bundle, minify, pwas, buildDateTime and buildNumber to the window.unite runtime variables</p>

            <hr/>

            <p>Added version check to interrogate the npm registry and notifiy you if a new version of the CLI is available.</p>

            <hr/>

            <p>If you build configuration contains a googleAnalyticsId your index page will have the GA script auto injected.</p>

            <h2>v1.6.0</h2>

            <p>Added support for
                <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Polymer">Polymer</a> as an application framework, this is based on the Polymer 3 preview so could see changes in future
                releases.
                <br/>Also @polymer/decorators is based on a
                <a href="https://github.com/unitejs-forks/polymer-decorators" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Polymer Decorators Fork">fork</a> so that it will work using npm as your package manager on windows (temporary until
                <a href="https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-decorators/issues/16" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Issue #16">Issue #16</a> is fixed or an official package is published).
                <br/>Jest (and more specifically JSDOM) and PhantomJS can not be used as unit test runners with Polymer as they
                lack some of the JavaScript features required.</p>

            <hr/>

            <p>Added support for transpilation of client packages, which means Preact can now support using AMD and SystemJS
                as module types.</p>

            <pre><code au-prism="nix">unite platform --operation=add --platformName=Docker</code></pre>

            <pre><code au-prism="nix">gulp platform-docker-package</code></pre>

            <p>Added support for

            </p>

            <p>The generate command replicates the functionality found in the platform specific CLIs (Angular CLI, Aurelia CLI,
                React create) and also adds a few more element types.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Angular - class, component, directive, enum, guard, interface, module, pipe, service</li>
                <li>Aurelia - attribute, binding-behavior, class, component, element, enum, interface, pipeline-step, value-converter</li>
                <li>PlainApp - class, enum, interface</li>
                <li>React - class, component, enum, interface</li>
            </ul>

            <p>All element types make the best use of your UniteJS setup, creating code, views styling and tests based on your
                configured options.</p>
